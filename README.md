# Detector

The codes are based on mmdetection. If you have never used the mmdetection framework before, please read the orignal [README](ORI_README.md) document.

## Template Detector

The detector takes two images as inputs: the template image and fact image. You can see the [detector code](mmdet/models/detectors/template_detector.py) for details.

Other implementation of the detector is similar to other mmdetection detectors.
